# Auto-Charge-Cut-Off-PCB

This repository contains the Altium Designer files for the **Auto-Charge-Cut-Off-PCB**, a compact and efficient solution for preventing overcharging in devices with lithium-ion batteries.  

## Overview
Lithium-ion batteries are sensitive to overcharging, which can lead to degradation, reduced lifespan, or even safety hazards. The **Auto-Charge-Cut-Off-PCB** is designed to address this issue by automatically cutting off the current flow to the battery once it is fully charged.
