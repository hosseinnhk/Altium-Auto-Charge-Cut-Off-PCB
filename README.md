# Auto-Charge-Cut-Off-PCB

This repository contains the Altium Designer files for the **Auto-Charge-Cut-Off-PCB**, a compact and efficient solution for preventing overcharging in devices with lithium-ion batteries.  

## Overview

Lithium-ion batteries are sensitive to overcharging, which can lead to degradation, reduced lifespan, or even safety hazards. The **Auto-Charge-Cut-Off-PCB** is designed to address this issue by automatically cutting off the current flow to the battery once it is fully charged.  

### Key Features
- **Overcharge Protection**: Prevents the battery from receiving further current when fully charged.  
- **Improved Battery Lifespan**: Reduces wear and tear on lithium-ion cells caused by overcharging.  
- **Safe Operation**: Minimizes the risk of overheating and ensures user safety.  

### How It Works
The PCB monitors the battery current and voltage during the charging process. Once the current reaches the predefined threshold (indicating full charge), the circuit automatically disconnects the power source, stopping the current flow to the battery.
